Slide 3:
Variable
a variable is an empty container similar to a glass, which has a capacity

Slide 4:
and before the variable's use in programming, it is neccessary to perform two operations:
- declare the variable (make the glass) - reserve the space where the data is to be stored.
- initialize the variable (put content in the glass) - in order to use the value.

Slide 5:
to create a variable you must use a type.
the type determines how much space is required to represent the data.
for example, we are talking about numbers--the data types are like matryoshka dolls. a larger container can hold a smaller one.

Slide 6:
very important:
if the content to be saved in the variable exceeds its capacity, there is an overflow.
if we want to save the contents of a larger container in a smaller container, it will not be possible because there will be an overflow or loss of data.

Slide 7:
it is common sense to avoid eating toast with an empty glass when we are thirsty, because ... 
it does not quench the thirst.
using a variable without initializing it is a serious error.

cartoon:
que sed - I'm thirsty!
quede con la misma sed - I was thirsty

Slide 8:
Operators
Arithmetic - add, subtract, multiply, divide
uselos son... - use them, they're free to save it
parantesis - paranthesis (hero)
se evalian... - are evaluated from left to right
order of evaluation
1 () paranthesis
2 * and /
3 + and -
