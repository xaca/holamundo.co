Slide 3:
Variable
A variable is an empty container, like a glass.

Slide 4:
In programming, before you can use a variable, it is necessary to perform two operations:
- declare the variable (create the glass) to reserve the space where the data is to be stored.
- initialize the variable (put the contents into the glass) in order to use the value.

Slide 5:
To create a variable you must use a type.
The type determines how much space is required to represent the data.
For example, we are talking about numbers - the data types are like matryoshka dolls. A larger container can hold a smaller one.

Slide 6:
Very important:
If the content to be saved in the variable exceeds its capacity, there is an overflow.
If we want to save the contents of a larger container in a smaller container, it will not be possible because there will be an overflow or loss of data.

Slide 7:
It is common sense not to eat toast, with an empty glass, when we are thirsty because ... 
it does not quench thirst.
Using a variable without initializing it is a serious error.

cartoon:
I'm thirsty!
I'm still thirsty

Slide 8:
Operators
Arithmetic - add, subtract, multiply, divide
Use them, they're free. They will save you.
Parentheses (hero)
They are evaluated from left to right.
order of evaluation
1 () parentheses
2 * and /
3 + and -

Slide 9:
Relationship: mua!
Greater than, equal to, less than, greater than or equal to, not equal to, less than or equal to
Compares the relationship between two numbers and tells us if it's true or false
Yeah, 5 is bigger than 2

### Slide 10: ###

watch out!
for life's love, don't confuse
assignment operator equality comparison operator
b = 5 assigns to b, the value 5
You == You, Are you equal to yourself?, yeah (true)

### Slide 11: ###

Logical
behind one of these doors, is the woman of your life
and or not
and: returns true if both values are true. Otherwise, false
or: returns false if both values are false. Otherwise, true
not: returns the opposite. true if the value is false. false if the value is true.

### Slide 12: ###

Control structures
if:
(Start)
    |
Condition - No - - -
    | Yes           |
[Do something]      |
    |  -  -  -  -  -|   
   End

(Dialogue): If I have the key, I get in

if (condition)
{
    // Cool code here!
}


### Slide 13: ###

if - else:
If I have money, I eat pizza
Else, i drink water

(Start)
    |
Condition - no  -  -  - |
    | Yes           run code 2
run code 1              |
    |  - - - - - - - - -|
   end

if (condition)
{
    //Cool code 1
}
else
{
    //Cool code 2
}


### Slide 14: ###

Cycles
while: 
if I'm not tired, I'll walk

(start)
    |
[condition] - no -> end
    | Yes
  execute

while (condition)
{
    // cool code here!
}

### Slide 15: ###

until:
Until I have money, I'll bet
inicio: start
ejecutar: execute
condición: condition
fin: end

do
{
    //cool code here!
}while (condition);

### Slide 16: ###

for:
One shot for every target

inicialización: initialization
incremento o decremento: increase or decrease
Código cool: Cool code

### Slide 17: ###
Variables bestiary

flag: is a control key for the program flow

bandera: flag

//salga de acá
//get outta here!


### Slide 18: ###
guard: guards and wait to have a certain value

centinela: guard

// get some value into "in_value"
guard = in_value;

checks if input value equals -1. If it does, the cycle ends

### Slide 19: ###

contador: counter
counter: counts a value. Generally one by one.

acumulador: accumulator
accumulator: is similar to a counter, but accumulates adding, dividing, multiplying, etc.

suma: sum

### Slide 20: ###

Vectors

is a programming structure that groups a fixed number of variables of the same type
                components
data ----- 35 ................
indexes    1   ...............
                length 4

### Slide 21: ###

datos: data
(dialogues): The train is created, 
             The train without wagons is useless
             It saves space for 4 wagons

### Slide 22: ###

(dialogues):    The content is being added
                Careful! If you put content in a position that doesn't exist, you lose the content

error: error

### Slide 23: ###

Matrices
is a structure that allows us to store data of the same type like a table with N rows and M columns
            8 columns
6 rows                  cell

### Slide 24: ###

datos: data
is possible to declare and initialize a vector or matrix like this: 
(dialogue): Assigns a value to the cell

### Slide 25: ###

Strings
a string is an alphanumeric value, or a set of characters. It works like a vector.
hola mundo: hello world
índices: indexes
10 total characters

### Slide 26: ###

s[0] returns a char. Is how we represent a character at a certain index. In this case, 0
s[0] -> h

strings are immutable. But they still have some powers that we'll call commands
hola: hello

Fabulous, Ohhh, Impressing, Wow

### Slide 27: ###

some commands:
hola: hello
mundo: world
adiós: goodbye

to see all commands, consult in the language API (?) on the Internet

(box):  Watch out! 
        == mustn't be used to compare
        if two strings are equal. You 
        should use Equals
